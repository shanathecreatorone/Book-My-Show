# Book-My-Show
REST and SOAP API solution to provide a holistic movie booking experience for customers, including the ability to book tickets, view movie options, and check movie showtimes.

BookMyShow seeks to revolutionize movie ticket booking by building a holistic platform. 
This solution includes displaying available movies, booking with eTickets, and offering group booking discounts. 
The IT landscape involves REST API-based Movie Management (MM) and SOAP API-driven Order Management (OM) systems. 
As part of the API team, the task involves designing the solution using MuleSoft, prioritizing API Led Connectivity, security with Client Id and Secret, and robust error handling. 
While assuming backend interfaces, mock endpoints simulate processes, supplemented by mUnit Tests. 
The aim is to create CI/CD Pipelines for CloudHub deployment.
